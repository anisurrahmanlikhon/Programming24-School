Programming24 School is a blog for programming. Manual code tracing is when the programmer interprets the results of each line of code and keeps track by hand of the effect of each statement. This type of code tracing is often faster than using a debugger to step through (trace) the execution of a program. 

C Programming Manual Tracing , and you will learn about them in a later lesson. While manually tracing code is more error prone than using a debugger tool, it is a skill that all good programmers possess. 

This is because knowing how to manually trace a small block of code correctly does not require a programmer to run an entire program over to see the affect of a small edit in the code. 

C Programming Manual Tracing is the process of executing program code by hand, with concrete inputs. Similar to how it is important for children to have the basic skills of reading before they can start writing their own sentences, it is important to be able to execute existing code by hand, before writing own code.
